# C Programming: A Modern Approach

Update: Moved this workspace to the jesseissorude github

The following are files, exercises, and projects from the book.  My goal is to sharpen my skills at C and programming in general.

One caveat: I have the first edition, so the projects are in ANSI C (C89/90), but there is a second edition of the book that uses C99.

To know when reading the book and ANSI C code:

- no line comments (`//`) supported
- variables can't be initialized in `for` loops
